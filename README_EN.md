# LeetCode Challenges

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems. The goal is to practice data structures, algorithms, and improve problem-solving skills.

## üå™Ô∏è Project Features
- Solutions organized by difficulty (**Easy, Medium, Hard**)
- Well-commented and documented code
- Use of different programming languages 

### Visual Example of the Project
- Structured in folders by problem category
- Each solution contains a description and explanation

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and Technologies Used
- **Algorithms:** Search algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, HashMaps, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, Javascript
- **Testing:** Unit tests to validate solutions

## üíΩ Project Structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project
To test and run the solutions locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>
   ```

2. **Choose a language and run the solution**:
    - Python:
      ```bash
      python python/easy/two_sum.py
      ```
    - TypeScript:
      ```bash
      npx tsx typescript/easy/two_sum.ts
      ```

3. **Run Tests**:
    - For Python, if you want to run tests automatically:
      ```bash
      pytest tests/
      ```

## üåê Deploy
Since this repository is for practice, deployment is not necessary. However, it is possible to host interactive solutions on platforms like GitHub Pages or Replit.

If you'd like to share the solutions, you can create a **GitHub Gist** or a **public repository** on GitHub.
